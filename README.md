### June 2022
This month I've graduated my primary school after 8 years of studying. At breaks, I was playing a lot with my friends in card game called "Pan" (in polish language), so I decided to make online game version of it!
Since in May I started learing Flutter, I've used this tool to make the frontend of the app. Also i needed backend. For that i've used popular Firebase backend service.
It's really nice but sometimes it's hard to parse data from it. Also, I've made Node.js app with TypeScript to handle request, and to manage Firebase.
