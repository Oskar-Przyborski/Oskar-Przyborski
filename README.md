## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm young dev with passion to programmingðŸ’»  
I just love sitting in my desktop and trying to code something that maybe someday will change the world to betterðŸŒŽ

### Expirience
I've started my journey with **Python** after deciding that **Scratch** is not enough for me. After learing the fundamentals I understood the basics of how programming works.  
After that, I've learned web developlment - **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS**. But also I've learned some frameworks: **React**, **Next.js**, and **Nuxt** and by the way **Node.js**.  
In the meantime I was creating games in **Unity**. This taught me **C#** and Advanced OOP concepts.  
Also, I've created some apps in **Flutter**. It's was really fun.
