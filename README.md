## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm young dev with passion to programmingðŸ’»  
I just love sitting in my desktop and trying to code something that maybe someday will change the world to betterðŸŒŽ

## Experience
I've started my journey with **Python** after deciding that **Scratch** is not enough for me. After learing the fundamentals I understood the basics of how programming works.  
After that, I've learned web developlment - **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS**. But also I've learned some frameworks: **React**, **Next.js**, and **Nuxt** and by the way **Node.js**.  
In the meantime I was creating games in **Unity**. This taught me **C#** and Advanced OOP concepts.  
Also, I've created some apps in **Flutter**. It's was really fun.  

## Projects
### Snakeish
There is a quite long story about this game. Firstly, it was created at the begining of April 2022. This version was using Next.js as a frontend, with TypeScript on the server. It was working nice, but the codebase was really hard to maintain.  
7 months later, in November, the server provider - Heroku - removed free plans, so the game went down, since i didn't want to pay. Fortunately, I found an free alternative for backend, and got motivation to remake the game.  
At the end of 2022, I've made a first commit to new version - snakeish-v2. I've decided to use some new technologies for me - SvelteKit, and Go. It's wasn't an easy thing (especially with Go), but I did it! The code is quite clean and extensible. By the way I've learned Go with concepts of composition.  
Currently, the game is available at [snakeish.vercel.app](https://snakeish.vercel.app)

### Skarbnik
I was thinking with my friends what can we build together. We came to the conclusion, that we will build something that can help people with managing money collection. A mobile app where users can register payments and analyze them.  
Project utilizes Flutter for the mobile app, .NET 7 with Entity Framework and MySQL database for the backend, and SvelteKit for the website.
