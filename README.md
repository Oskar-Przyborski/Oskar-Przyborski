## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm young dev with passion to programming ðŸ’»  
I just love sitting in my desktop and trying to code something that maybe someday will change the world to better ðŸŒŽ

## Experience
HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Discord.js, React, Next.js, Nuxt, Sanity.io, SvelteKit, Python, Go, .NET, ASP.NET Web API, .NET Entity Framework, SQL, Unity, Lua, Dart, Flutter, Firebase, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin. ðŸ§   
So basically, I tried many technologies and I can learn pretty anything âš¡

## Projects
### Snakeish
There is a quite long story about this game. Firstly, it was created at the begining of April 2022. This version was using Next.js as a frontend, with TypeScript on the server. It was working nice, but the codebase was really hard to maintain.  
7 months later, in November, the server provider - Heroku - removed free plans, so the game went down, since i didn't want to pay. Fortunately, I found an free alternative for backend, and got motivation to remake the game.  
At the end of 2022, I've made a first commit to new version - snakeish-v2. I've decided to use some new technologies for me - SvelteKit, and Go. It's wasn't an easy thing (especially with Go), but I did it! The code is quite clean and extensible. By the way I've learned Go with concepts of composition.  
Currently, the game is available at [snakeish.vercel.app](https://snakeish.vercel.app)

### Skarbnik
I was thinking with my friends what can we build together. We came to the conclusion, that we will build something that can help people with managing money collection. A mobile app where users can register payments and analyze them.  
Project utilizes Flutter for the mobile app, .NET 7 with Entity Framework and MySQL database for the backend, and SvelteKit for the website.  
Check out [Skarbnik website](https://skarbnik.app/) and, maybe, try it yourself!
